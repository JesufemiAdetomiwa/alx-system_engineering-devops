Issue Summary:

Duration: Start Time: August 08, 2023, 09:00 AM (UTC)
End Time: August 08, 2023, 11:30 AM (UTC)
Impact: Web Application Service Outage

During the outage, the web application experienced slow response times and intermittent failures, affecting approximately 30% of users. Users were encountering prolonged load times and occasional error messages.

Timeline:

09:00 AM: The issue was initially detected by monitoring alerts indicating a significant increase in response time.
09:15 AM: Engineers started investigating the issue by checking server health and database performance.
09:30 AM: Assumption was made that the slow response might be due to high database load, leading to a deep dive into database query optimization.
10:15 AM: Database query optimization efforts did not yield expected improvements. Attention shifted to the application servers.
10:30 AM: Investigation revealed high memory and CPU utilization on multiple application servers.
10:45 AM: Incident was escalated to the Infrastructure Team for further assistance and collaboration.
11:00 AM: Collaboration between the Application and Infrastructure Teams revealed a memory leak in a critical service.
11:30 AM: The issue was resolved by restarting the affected service, restoring normal response times.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The root cause of the slow response and intermittent failures was identified as a memory leak in a critical service. The memory leak led to increased memory consumption, causing high CPU utilization and impacting the application's performance.

Resolution: The issue was resolved by restarting the affected service, which cleared the memory leak and restored normal response times. The service's code was also reviewed and optimized to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Memory Leak Detection: Implement regular memory leak detection and monitoring mechanisms to catch and address memory leaks early.
Automated Scaling: Enhance the system's auto-scaling capabilities to handle increased load during traffic spikes, minimizing the impact on user experience.
Thorough Testing: Strengthen testing procedures to include load testing, performance testing, and memory profiling to identify potential issues before deployment.
